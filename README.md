## Limitations

These aren't just limitations â€” I plan to work on them!

1) This "chat app" doesn't currently allow messaging someone who hasn't registered with the app.
2) Zod for validation
3) There's no option for voice or video calls yet.
4) Group chat functionality is not available at the moment.
5) The app isn't built for large-scale use yet. I'll gradually introduce Kafka, Redis, Microservices Architecture, Load Balancers, and other scaling solutions.
